A bug has been fixed that made the ``TimedRotatingFileHandler`` use the
MTIME attribute of the configured log file to to detect whether it has to be
rotated yet or not. In cases when the file was changed within the rotation
period the value of the MTIME was also updated to the current time and as a
result the rotation never happened. The file creation time (CTIME) is used
instead that makes the rotation file modification independent.
